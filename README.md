SimpleOne: use exponentiation by squaring and modular exponentiation.

#Div mod:

(a + b) %n = (a%n + b %n) %n


(a*b)%n = (a%n * b %n)%n

#Next Square

n^2 = (n-1)^2 + (n-1) + n


#PRIME FACTORIZATION

For every unique  prime factor there are (a+1)(b+1)... possible factors. For a square number x^2: every factor less than x, there is a factor greater than x. Thus, there are (a+1)(b+1).../2 factors less than x - including 1.
